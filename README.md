<h1 align="center">Milestone 3 Report</h1>
<h3 align="center"> Static Website on GitHub</h3>

<br><br>


<h2 align="left">Abstract</h3>
<p>In Milestone 3 we were able to work together and create a mostly static website using html. From a themewagon.com template, we edited the code using html in order to figure out exactly how we want our website to look on the front end, without having to worry about any of the functionality. This way, we would pinpoint on the design of the website. To accomplish this, we divided the work and practiced pair programming, then eventually came together using github and merged all of our work together. Now that we have the design of our website ready, we are ready to focus on making an interactive website.

<h2 align="left">Results</h2>
<p>In this milestone, we each split up into groupsâ€“ one for dashboards for athlete, coach, and PEAK admin, another group to focus on the design for permissions (which is an extension of the PEAK admin view), and had a Scrum Master (Sinan) who worked on the repository and all the github, as well as helped us with any html or github questions. We eventually, after pair programming, came together and pushed all of our edits to the original themewagon.com template in our repository to create the website shown below. </p>
