<h1 align="center">Milestone 3 Report</h1>
<h3 align="center"> Static Website on GitHub</h3>

<br><br>


<h2 align="left">Abstract</h3>
<p>In Milestone 3 we were able to work together and create a mostly static website using html. From a themewagon.com template, we edited the code using html in order to figure out exactly how we want our website to look on the front end, without having to worry about any of the functionality. This way, we would pinpoint on the design of the website. To accomplish this, we divided the work and practiced pair programming, then eventually came together using github and merged all of our work together. Now that we have the design of our website ready, we are ready to focus on making an interactive website. 
</p>

<br><br>

<h2 align="left">Results</h2>
<p>In this milestone, we each split up into groups– one for dashboards for athlete, coach, and PEAK admin, another group to focus on the design for permissions (which is an extension of the PEAK admin view), and had a Scrum Master (Sinan) who worked on the repository and all the github, as well as helped us with any html or github questions. We eventually, after pair programming, came together and pushed all of our edits to the original themewagon.com template in our repository to create the website shown below. </p>

<h2 align="left">Team Reflection</h3>
	This milestone was critical to our team development as we had to balance working separately, transitioning to pair programming once we were back together, and finally pushing all of our work together and making sure it flowed coherently and looked professional. We also all helped each other by playing to each other’s strengths and weaknesses, so we are all much more comfortable asking each other questions now that we know how to help each other best. This milestone was also crucial to immersing ourselves in HTML and CSS, since the majority of our group had never used these before. Instead of listening to lectures, we learned much faster by looking at stellar examples of HTML from our template, then adjusting it to our specific wants and needs. We also, with the much-needed help of our Scrum Master, learned how to use github to work together, make commits, push, merge, and make pull requests. We are now much more prepared for the new, more involved milestones we will have to accomplish.

Adapted the HTML from the Corona template to create the following pages: 
Permissions.html, which is essentially where PEAK admin can choose a team, coach, or athlete and choose to adjust their permissions. They can also choose to add a user here.
Athletepermissions.html, which adjusts athlete permissions
Coachpermissions.html, which adjusts coach permissions
Addcoach.html, which adds a coach
Addathlete.html which adds an athlete and adds personal information about the athlete
Addpeak.html, which adds an admin
Focused on design elements for the above pages and created a baseline for the rest of the group to approve, improve, and adapt

<h2 align="left">Extensions</h3>

_Extension 1: Adding a bit of functionality and making our static website somewhat interactive._
	
<p>	We used a bit of our previous knowledge of HTML from lectures and quizzes to make the permissions part of the software somewhat interactive. Clicking on Add User on the left will lead to a drop down so you can choose to add an athlete, coach, or PEAK admin. If you click on one of these options, you are immediately redirected to the permissions page that allows that. You can also click on a specific athlete or coach to lead to their specific permissions page, which differs based on if you click athlete or coach. </p>

_Extension 2: Using Netlify to automatically deploy static website and PR previews to a live server._

<p>	We used Netlify to create a free account and attach our GitHub repo for this project. Netlify is able to host static websites for us, creating both a production deploy at the defined “main” branch, as well as creating automatic “preview” PRs that show what a PR would look like when merged. These preview PRs facilitate much faster and reliable peer review, and they also update automatically when new commits are added to a PR. </p>

_Extension 3: Write your report in Markdown as a readme file in your repository, including table images and appropriate tags and content._

<p> We recreated this exact interactive report on the GitHub repository in the README.md file. The link to the README.md file (i.e. on the main repository) is this. </p>
